Proposed workflow

Lettersized TUL notebook -> Actual notes for understanding long-term.
Laptop (zenbook-duo) -> Start homework assignments on this, it's very handy. Then export .xopp files as a .PDF to continue working on my tablet
Samsung s6 lite tablet -> For in-person notes (if I ever go irl, lol), Scratch-work for online quizzes, and continuation of homeworks started on Xournal++
Junior-sized discbound notebook -> just in-case, handy notebook :)

**note, I'll probably use something Termux to git pull/push from my tablet.

For my TUL notebook, I'd like to upload pictures of my notes onto here. That would give me motivation. I love committing to this platform!!

In the future, maybe my website can have a "Status report" section that includes my latest commits, which includes this whole academic thing lol
